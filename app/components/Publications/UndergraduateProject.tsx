Using Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology, we designed and constructed a cost-effective system capable of producing high-purity nitrogen (99.98%) at a rate of up to 60 L/day. The system was designed to operate with clean, dry compressed air to generate nitrogen in both gaseous and liquid states, providing a continuous supply for laboratory applications while maintaining process stability and cost efficiency.",

Liquid nitrogen is essential for various laboratory experiments, cryogenic research, and equipment maintenance. The department required a reliable, in-house solution that could produce high-purity nitrogen to avoid contamination risks in sensitive experiments and analyses. Our project aimed to develop a sustainable, cost-effective solution to this critical infrastructure gap.",

                content: "The project was structured in four key phases: design, material acquisition, construction, and testing/simulation. We began with detailed 2D schematic diagrams that served as the foundation for the plant structure. The system design incorporated a scrubber to remove H‚ÇÇO and CO‚ÇÇ from intake air, a compressor with micron filtering, high-pressure cooling through an ice bath, and PSA towers filled with Carbon Molecular Sieve (CMS). The PSA system used Arduino-controlled pneumatic valves to regulate airflow between towers, selectively adsorbing oxygen while allowing nitrogen to pass through. I personally created detailed 3D models in SolidWorks to visualize the complete assembly and identify potential design flaws before construction began.",

                content: "The construction phase required significant hands-on engineering skills. I learned welding specifically for this project, (I really had a great time doing that) to ensure high-pressure integrity of the metal components. The fabrication involved precision metal work for the PSA towers (As you can probably tell, it wasn't precise... My fault üôè), compressor integration, and cooling systems. Each component was carefully assembled and tested for pressure tolerance. The thermodynamic cooling chamber was constructed with multiple layers of glass fiber insulation (We were safe), which our research confirmed would provide sufficient thermal isolation for the Joule-Thomson refrigeration process to occur effectively. The control system utilized an Arduino-based controller to manage the PSA cycling process through solid-state relays and pneumatic valves.",

                content: "Extensive simulations were conducted using SolidWorks 2021 (Yes! it was licensed) and MATLAB (the free option) to validate the design. I ran computational models for the cooling tower to determine optimal pressure ranges and temperature drops for nitrogen liquefaction (Learnt a very important lesson simulation ‚â† reality). Simulations were performed at various pressures (500 kPa and 1 MPa) with both ideal and real gas models for 78% pure nitrogen. These simulations were crucial for understanding the thermodynamic behavior of the system and identifying potential failure points before physical testing. The analysis revealed that pressures above 6 bar would be necessary for effective nitrogen liquefaction with our 2HP compressor setup, though this approached the critical operating capacity of the compressor.",

Our findings confirmed that glass fiber is an effective insulation material for creating the thermodynamic conditions necessary for Joule-Thomson refrigeration. While we were unable to achieve full production testing due to material constraints (specifically the Carbon Molecular Sieve and oxygen analyzers), our pressure testing and simulations indicated that the system design was sound. The 2HP compressor proved capable of generating pressures sufficient for nitrogen liquefaction, though we recommended a more powerful compressor for higher production rates and longer operational periods.",

                content: "Throughout the project, we encountered several significant engineering challenges. One major obstacle was creating a leak-proof system capable of maintaining the high pressures required for PSA operation.  As I was in charge of structural integrity and simulations, I addressed this through meticulous welding and connection designs ( Again, I had to learn that on the spot ü§£), implementing multiple redundant sealing methods at critical junctions. Another challenge was the thermal management needed for efficient liquefaction ( NB: It got hot and melted pipes ü§£ü§£). By applying thermodynamic principles (Lots of suffering üòä), I designed a graduated cooling system that progressively lowered gas temperature while maintaining pressure until the final expansion and phase change (that worked for 8 min before Death). Material constraints, particularly the specialized Carbon Molecular Sieve, required creative sourcing solutions and adaptation of the design to work with locally available alternatives where possible.",

While full production testing awaits the acquisition of specialized components like the Carbon Molecular Sieve and precise measurement instruments, the mechanical system, control logic, and structural elements were successfully completed. Our research confirmed that a localized, cost-effective liquid nitrogen production system is feasible for educational institutions. Future work will focus on optimizing the compressor capacity for increased production rates, investigating alternative adsorbent materials, and implementing more sophisticated monitoring systems. The project demonstrates the viability of small-scale cryogenic systems for educational and research applications.",

                        This undergraduate thesis project was a comprehensive engineering challenge that developed my skills across mechanical engineering, thermodynamics, fabrication, and control systems. The hands-on experience of designing, modeling, simulating, and constructing a complex cryogenic system provided invaluable practical knowledge that continues to influence my approach to engineering problems.
