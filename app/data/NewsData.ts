This high school experience has provided a strong foundation in the sciences and has confirmed my desire to pursue physics at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Whatever challenges lie ahead, I'll face them with the same persistence and curiosity that have brought me to this milestone.

To my teachers, classmates, family, and the UNHCR staff who supported my education - thank you for being part of this journey. This is just the beginning!`,
